# recursiveCopy
a python script to recursively traverse directories and copy all contents to a new folder of your choosing.  Great for merging files after a datarecovery.

This should work in win 10, linux and most likely MAC.
I can't test on a MAC because I do not have one.  If you want to buy me one HMU ;-)
